#XYZ Reader

This repository stores the code for the XYZ Reader project that I modified from Udacity's starting code found
at this repo: (https://github.com/udacity/xyz-reader-starter-code/)

The task here was to create a better user experience from a clunky, slow, and ugly starting app. It follows guidlines from Google's design team. 

## Getting Started

If you want to see the application in action, clone the project and unzip it to your desired folder location. Open the project in Android Studio and build. 

Note: Android Studio may ask you to update certain dependencies. This is not reccomended as the project hasn't been tested using other configurations. Ignore these updates and run in an emulator with an Android APK level declared in the app folder's build.gradle file for the most reliable and stable experience.

### Built With

* [Picasso](https://github.com/square/picasso) - A powerful image downloading and caching library for Android
* [OkHttp](https://github.com/square/okhttp) - An HTTP & HTTP/2 client for Android and Java applications. Helps with network performance.
